This R code generates a reproducible two-sided matching market in which m men and n women are matched up by the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) by Gale & Shapley. This code allows to analyze the effect of set size, gender distribution and preference structures (perfectly independent, correlated, intercorrelated, or weighted) on both the male-optimal and the female-optimal version of the DAA
